This iteration of the PhotoLab project is meant to be modular, but also adds some new functions fuch as Posterize, Noise, and 
Negative. The Negative function inverts the colors of the image by subtracting 255 from each pixel value. The Noise function 
adds'n' grains of white pixels, randomized by using the <time.h> header. The Posterize function takes in 3 inputs to 
indicate the number of bits to be posterized, and then uses bitwise operators to change the appropriate number of bits.
In the main function, I have IFDEF debugging enabled to run just the AutoTest (test all functions) function. I also
have modules for the Advanced image library, Digital Image Processing (DIPs) library, and their corresponding header 
files, as well as a constants header file to house all of the constants. Finally, my makefile compiles all the
necessary output files, and also the executables. It has a clean target to clean out all output files, as well 
as all images in the directory.
