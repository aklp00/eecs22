This assignment is the first version of the PhotoLab Assignment. It implements a sharpen function, aging function, 
edge detection function, as well as a menu function that allows the user to select the operation to perform on the image. 
The LoadImage and SaveImage functions allow the user to save the operated image into a separate file, which is then 
viewable on the Bondi server. The way I implemented the required functions (Sharpen, Edge Detection, PrintMenu) were as follows.
For Sharpen, I multiplied each target pixel by nine and subtracted the value of each surrounding pixel. For Edge Detection,
I did a similar operation, except instead of multiplying the target pixel by nine I multiplied it by 8. Lastly, for the 
PrintMenu() function, I added printf() statements displaying the different operations available. In the main() function, I call 
the PrintMenu() function and also allow user input to type in the image they want to load as well as the different operations 
to perform on the image.
