This assignment is the first version of the PhotoLab Assignment. It implements a sharpen function, aging function, 
edge detection function, as well as a menu function that allows the user to select the operation to perform on the image. 
The LoadImage and SaveImage functions allow the user to save the operated image into a separate file, which is then

For Sharpen, I multiplied each target pixel by nine and subtracted the value of each surrounding pixel. For Edge Detection,
I did a similar operation, except instead of multiplying the target pixel by 8, I multiplied
